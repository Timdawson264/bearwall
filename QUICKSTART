Make sure you either have all the modules compiled in, or have automatic
module probing enabled in your kernel.  (Why does debian's UML have neither?)

See the above link for some FAQ's

To build and install, just run 

	make install

This will place the firewall script in /usr/local/firewall and the 
configuration in /usr/local/etc/linuxserver-firewall

If you run Debian or Ubuntu (or any other .deb based distro) please consider
using a prebuilt .deb

For a quick start, if your internal interface is eth0 and your external 
interface is ppp0:
 
 cd /usr/local/etc/linuxserver-firewall/interfaces.d
 ln -s ../classes.d/internal eth0.if
 ln -s ../classes.d/external ppp0.if
 ln -s ../classes.d/loopback lo.if
 ./firewall
