# If you want to restrict external access further you can add an extra

# Advanced Configuration Examples

# Portforward external port 1234 to 1.2.3.4:5678
#policy prerouting-in DNAT --protocol tcp --dport 1234 --to 1.2.3.4:5678

# Having issues with stupid people breaking path MTU?
# policy out TCPMSS --protocol tcp --set-mss 576 --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN \
#   --destination 1.2.3.4

# Allow any traffic generated on this machine out to the Internet

# Keep the internet clean - block known MS worm traffic
