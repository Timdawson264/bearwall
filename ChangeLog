* Convert from SF CVS to source.meta.net.nz SVN

* Merge in IT Partners linuxserver-firewall changes
  - log-prefix now has "FW/" prepended for all logs
  - Allow for FHS / Debian directory layouts
  - Check interfaces.d exists and contains files
    - Fix bug that allowed execution to continue if interfaces.d didn't
      exist !

* Move hosts.d to $CONFDIR, not $BASEDIR (they are user configured host
  overrides !)

* Changed syntax of how $IPTABLES was set in rulset.functions for 
  consistency.

* Added simple command line options, -v or --version for the current version
  or anything else tells you to read the man page.

* Move all sanity tests to the top of the script so we don't start building
  the firewall only to find we don't have something later !

* Removed all.host from hosts.d that used to point all OUTPUT to the classify 
  ruleset. Playing with TOS bits can cause problems on todays broken Intarweb.

* Made modprobe that may file use "-q" to supress error output.

* Made the documentation and firewall be built by the Makefile so they all
  refer to the correct file locations.

* Split up Makefile install into install-bin and install-conf, added 
  install-doc and made install depend on all of them.

* Reverted installing rulsets +x as we don't believe it's required.

* Fixed 2.4/2.6 issue, will now work on both versions

* Fixed bash LANG problem that broke a check

* Don't complain if there are no host exceptions.

* Fixed nasty bug with FORWARD chain (which nobody used anyway, sigh)

* Added some new rulesets (routing-trust) and cleaned up some others
 
* Added some more examples to the classes

* Added support for more of the mangle table targets

* Fixed bug with leaving empty chains around the place

* Fixed bug with spewing errors about not being able to delete chains

* Default log level is now very low, except for End of * messages, added
comment to these to hint that these are a configuration error.

* Moved all the examples out of interfaces.d into classes.d and recommended
people create symlinks from interfaces.d into classes.d

* added ifup and ifdown firewall scripts to add and delete an interface.  
This involved a lot of restructuring.  a series of new chains were created
called "in-fw", "out-fw" etc, the various interface chains are linked off
these.  ifup and ifdown can take a second argument which is the "fake" name
of the interface.  for example if you have a wireless network card:
 # start up at home
 ifup eth0 home
 # ... play ...
 # leave home
 ifdown eth0
 # get to work
 ifup eth0 work
 # ... work ...
 # leave work
 ifdown eth0
 # etc
