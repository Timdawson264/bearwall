#
# Bearwall configuration file
#
# This file is used to configure the behaviour of bearwall, firewall rules
# are configured in @CONFDIR@/interfaces.d and @CONFDIR@/classes.d
#

#
# Logging
#
# Where should firewall rule matches be logged to?
#
# Values:
#    - syslog
#        Logs end up in /var/log/bearwall.log, the downside of syslog is
#        that dmesg gets polluted with rule matches
#    - nflog
#        Packets that match firewall rules will be passed to the userspace
#        daemon ulogd which will then log packets to the log file configured
#        in /etc/ulogd.conf (/var/log/ulog/syslogemu.log by default)
#    - none
#        Don't log matched packets
#
# Default: logging=syslog
logging=syslog
